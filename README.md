# ENSE-271-Project

## South Saskatchewan Community Foundation [SSCF](https://sscf.ca/) Project Document. 

Team name: Prototype Hype

Members:
* Mohammed Alharbi
* Jay Chandrakant Patel
* Vishv Patel


Introduction\
Our team, Prototype Hype, consisting of Mohammed, Jay and Vishv, has been tasked with upgrading the platform of the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation. The organization is a connection between donors and charities but is facing challenges with its current platform, which is difficult to navigate for potential donors.

NorthStar Customer\
  The primary focus of this project is to design a user-friendly website that is easy to navigate for potential donors. Our goal is to provide potential donors with the information they need to make informed decisions about where to allocate their resources and increase donations.

Carryover Customers\
  In addition to the primary focus, we aim to establish effective communication with other carryover customers including government organizations, charity sectors, and volunteers. For government organizations, we aim to provide updates and open channels of collaboration. For charitable organizations, we aim to share our work and potential partnership opportunities. For volunteers, our goal is to present the opportunities and benefits of volunteering with the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation.

Technical Considerations\
  We are building the platform using WordPress, as per the request of the customer, who wants to be able to control the website and edit their viral sign research in the future.

Constraints\
  The project faces some constraints such as limited data provided by the customer and the need to use the WordPress platform. 

Conclusion\
  Our goal is to create an interactive experience that provides an overview of the information in an easy-to-digest format such as infographics or storytelling. This will help donors, volunteers, and government officials understand the needs of their community and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources.

#### Activity 1:

For this activity, we meet each other as group and discuss what was the customer facing and what discovering Northstar & carryover customers. Also, we started creating our Empathy as individual and then combing to one group map. Next, we stated barnstorming by creating unorganized sticky notes putting them in the tables and started creating them using software like MURAL for more clear view of the notes. Finally, we started doing user story map (USM) using sticky notes and sketches to outline the interactions that the team expects users to go through to complete our goals in a digital product.

Here are the lists of files we have created so far for this activity:
1. Folder with all files related to [Affinity Diagrams](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/tree/main/Affinity%20Diagrams)

##### First check-in meeting with the customer was in Jan.30, 2023 (4:00-5:15)
**[Summarized customer](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Documents/Summarized%20customer%20notes%20for%20activity%201.pdf)**\
On the check-in day, the customer discussed filtering through the report. They highlighted the importance of showcasing the graphs of money required by the charities and the money that has been donated to them. They emphasized the need to focus on new donors, be it a new donor or an existing one. The customer also suggested that it would be a good idea to demonstrate or implement the feedback received from the donors.

#### Activity 2:

For this activity, we began creating our first low-fi prototype both individually and as a group using paper and pencil. We created three site maps and prototypes and combined them into one group site map and prototype. Additionally, we provided a one-page document explaining the three topics related to people-centered design that we discussed in class and incorporated them into our prototype. Lastly, we updated our user story map as it had some small changes compared to the previous USM.

Here are the lists of files we have created so far for this activity:

##### Second check-in date: Feb.13, 2023 (4:00 pm - 5:15 pm)
**[Summarized customer](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Documents/Summarized%20customer%20notes%20for%20activity%202.pdf)**\
During today's check-in meeting with our customer, we were informed about the three main focus areas for the project. The customer emphasized the importance of implementing filtering capabilities to allow users to filter reports based on their location or region preferences. This would provide users with a more personalized experience, as they would only receive reports that are relevant to their specific location or region. The customer also emphasized the need to provide brief summaries of each report, allowing users to get a quick understanding of what each report contains. This would be achieved by using summary cards, which were well received in our prototype. The idea behind this is to provide users with a quick overview of the report and to encourage them to click and read the full report if they are interested in learning more. Another key aspect of the project that the customer focused on, was the use of infographs to display feedback for the reports. These infographs would provide users with a visual representation of the data contained in the reports, making it easier to understand and digest. This would also make the reports more engaging and interesting to read. Finally, the customer informed us that they will be providing us with four reports to work with in the project. Our goal is to implement the filtering and summarization capabilities, as well as the use of infographs, to make these reports accessible and easy to understand for all users. By doing so, we aim to meet the customer's needs and provide them with a valuable and useful product.

#### Activity 3:

In this activity, our team used Figma software to collaboratively create a Hi-Fi prototype. Firstly, we created a group project file on Figma, which allowed every team member to edit the file. Following the customer's request, we began with the desktop version and also included a mobile version as an additional feature.


Here are the lists of files we have created so far for this activity:
- Desktop and Mobile version of the Hi-Fi prototype, which can be found in PDF files. Each page of the PDF file indicates a frame in Figma.
  - [Hi-Fi prototype Desktop](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Prototypes/Hi-Fi%20Prototype%20Desktop.pdf)
  - [Hi-Fi prototype Mobile](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Prototypes/Hi-Fi%20Prototype%20Mobile.pdf)
  
- Document file that outlines the topics discussed in class and how we implemented them in our Hi-Fi prototype.
  - [Hi-Fi Design Ideas](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Documents/Hifi%20Design%20Idea.pdf)
  
- Document of 5 usability questionnaire that we disscussed in the class with Feedbackers group
  - [Usability Questionnaire](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Documents/Formative%20usability%20questionnaire-1.pdf)

- User story map can be found [Here](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/User%20story%20map/User%20Story%20Map.pdf)

- Desktop and Mobile version of the Hi-Fi prototype in Figma can be found [Here](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Prototypes/Hi-Fi%20Prototype.fig)

##### Third check-in date: Feb.27, 2023 (4:40-4:50: Prototype Hype)
**[Summarized customer](https://github.com/M-Alharbi/ENSE-271-Project/blob/main/Documents/Summarized%20customer%20notes%20for%20activity%203.pdf)**\
During our third check-in meeting with the customer, things were going quite well. We presented our hi-fi prototype, which was almost fully functional, and demonstrated how to navigate through the website. To align the prototype with the customer's website, we created a new tab called "research page" to house all reports. We received a lot of feedback regarding the prototype. One major suggestion was to create a template for the report pages, so that users could easily navigate and use them. Additionally, staff members should be able to edit the reports with ease.
During the presentation, we also showcased the filter button and discussed some upcoming features. We asked for suggestions from the customer regarding the filter button, and he proposed that users should be able to search for reports by region, specific reports, year, and/or area.
Overall, the meeting was productive and provided us with valuable insights that we will use to improve our prototype.
