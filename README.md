Introduction\
Our team, Prototype Hype, consisting of Mohammed, Jay and Vishv, has been tasked with upgrading the platform of the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation. The organization is a connection between donors and charities but is facing challenges with its current platform, which is difficult to navigate for potential donors.

NorthStar Customer\
  The primary focus of this project is to design a user-friendly website that is easy to navigate for potential donors. Our goal is to provide potential donors with the information they need to make informed decisions about where to allocate their resources and increase donations.

Carryover Customers\
  In addition to the primary focus, we aim to establish effective communication with other carryover customers including government organizations, charity sectors, and volunteers. For government organizations, we aim to provide updates and open channels of collaboration. For charitable organizations, we aim to share our work and potential partnership opportunities. For volunteers, our goal is to present the opportunities and benefits of volunteering with the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation.

Technical Considerations\
  We are building the platform using WordPress, as per the request of the customer, who wants to be able to control the website and edit their viral sign research in the future.

Constraints\
  The project faces some constraints such as limited data provided by the customer and the need to use the WordPress platform. 

Conclusion\
  Our goal is to create an interactive experience that provides an overview of the information in an easy-to-digest format such as infographics or storytelling. This will help donors, volunteers, and government officials understand the needs of their community and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources.



Summarized customer check-in\
On the check-in day, the customer discussed filtering through the report. They highlighted the importance of showcasing the graphs of money required by the charities and the money that has been donated to them. They emphasized the need to focus on new donors, be it a new donor or an existing one. The customer also suggested that it would be a good idea to demonstrate or implement the feedback received from the donors.
