Propose site navigations/site maps as well as low-fidelity interface designs (paper and pencil). Update the user story mapping 
illustrating key Minimum Viable Products as needed. On the check-in "due" date listed above, teams will discuss knowledge gained via 
the documents below with key customers to confirm project planning activities and envisioned design directions

Required files in Team GitHubs. All of the below must be satisfied to achieve a grade within the "acceptable" range.

	- Customer presentation and team professionalism (see below)
	
	- Proposed navigation(s)/site map(s), i.e. how your team envisions supporting "digital wayfinding" 
	(teams should produce at least one navigation/site map/team member, e.g. a team of 3 should have at least 3 different 
	site maps proposals to be tested/explored.
	
	- Low-fidelity prototype explorations (teams should produce at least one low-fidelity interface/team member, e.g. a team of 3 should have at least 3 different low-fidelity prototypes to be tested/explored.
		* Ensure low-fidelity prototypes link to design ideas discussed in class; a minimum of three topics discussed in 
		  class relating to people-centred design (affordances, gestalt, constraints, etc.). 
		* Document these in a 1-page PDF
		
	- Updated user story map (USM), if required (regardless, ensure to do a PDF export from StoriesOnBoard) with envisioned 
	   MVPs as a snapshot of changes/no changes)
	   
	- Summarized customer notes from customer check-ins (2-page maximum)
