During today's check-in meeting with our customer, we were informed about the three main focus areas for the project. The customer emphasized the importance of implementing filtering capabilities to allow users to filter reports based on their location or region preferences. This would provide users with a more personalized experience, as they would only receive reports that are relevant to their specific location or region.

The customer also emphasized the need to provide brief summaries of each report, allowing users to get a quick understanding of what each report contains. This would be achieved by using summary cards, which were well received in our prototype. The idea behind this is to provide users with a quick overview of the report and to encourage them to click and read the full report if they are interested in learning more.

Another key aspect of the project that the customer focused on, was the use of infographs to display feedback for the reports. These infographs would provide users with a visual representation of the data contained in the reports, making it easier to understand and digest. This would also make the reports more engaging and interesting to read.

Finally, the customer informed us that they will be providing us with four reports to work with in the project. Our goal is to implement the filtering and summarization capabilities, as well as the use of infographs, to make these reports accessible and easy to understand for all users. By doing so, we aim to meet the customer's needs and provide them with a valuable and useful product.
